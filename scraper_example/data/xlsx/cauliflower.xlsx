"1It is assumed that fresh cauliflower is cooked prior to consumption. Based on Agriculture Handbook No.102, ERS further assumes that 8 percent of a fully-trimmed head is inedible, including outer leaf stems and core. Florets are assumed to include no refuse. According to the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), an additional 3 percent of the weight is lost through cooking for both products. Finally, based on these figures, ERS estimates an overall preparation yield of about 89 percent for fully-trimmed heads and 97 percent for florets.  ",,,,,,
