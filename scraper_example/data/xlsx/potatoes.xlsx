Based on the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), ERS assumes that 65 percent of the can's gross weight is solid and 35 percent is liquid medium. The FPED cup equivalent weight for canned potatoes is the weight of the solids and not of the liquid medium in which the vegetable is packed. The preparation yield factor for canned potatoes in the above table does not account for any further preparation that occurs prior to consumption.",,,,,,
