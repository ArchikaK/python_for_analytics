"2Includes a variety of mixed fruits like pears, peaches, pineapples, and grapes. The syrup (or water) is discarded prior to consumption. Based on the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), ERS assumes that 65 percent of the can's gross weight is solid and 35 percent is liquid. The FPED cup equivalent weight for canned fruit is the weight of the solids and not of the liquid medium in which it is packed. The preparation yield factor for canned fruit cocktail in the above table does not account for any further preparation that occurs prior to consumption. ",,,,,,
