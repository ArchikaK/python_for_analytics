"1Includes globe and french artichokes; excludes Jerusalem artichokes. It is assumed that fresh artichokes are cooked prior to consumption. Consumers also discard the inedible stem along with the inedible parts of the bracts and flowers. The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) reports that about 40 percent of a raw artichoke is edible, while the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) reports that about 6 percent of this edible share is further lost through cooking. Overall, ERS estimates that each pound of raw artichoke purchased at retail yields about 0.38 pounds of consumable vegetable.",,,,,,

"2Includes artichoke hearts and bottoms. The liquid contents of the can (or jar) are discarded prior to consumption. Based on the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), ERS assumes that 65 percent of the can's gross weight is solid and 35 percent is liquid medium. The FPED cup equivalent weight for canned artichokes is the weight of the solids and not of the liquid medium in which the vegetable is packed. The preparation yield factor for canned artichokes in the above table does not account for any further preparation that occurs prior to consumption.",,,,,,
